## Description
Understanding interactions between proteins and ligands is of great importance for various branches of molecular biology. Examples of its usage include, but are not limited to, developing new medicines or improving existing ones, as well as getting a better understanding of various biochemical processes.

BioDock Visualiser is a webtool that allows users to dock ligands onto proteins and visualise the result afterwards. The process of 'docking' refers to predicting the most likely configuration of a ligand when it attaches itself to a protein.


### Key-features
- Docks selected ligand onto selected protein,
- Returns lig.dok-file with (up to 20) possible ligand configurations, sorted from most-likely to least-likely configuration*,
- Returns visualisation of selected ligand configurations, in which part of the protein will be visible and showing the bonds between ligand and protein,
- User-friendly webtool interface, with options like which configurations the user wants to be visible in the visualisation, etc.

*This is based on the amount of kcal/mol that the ligand configuration gives when binding to a protein, the more kcal/mol, the more likely the configuration will be.

## Installation and system requirements <br>
### system requirements: <br>
- OS, linux
- Python 3.0 or higher
- pip3


### Installing tools: <br>
To install the tools ledock/lepro/lefrag:
```bash
~$ wget http://www.lephar.com/download/ledock_linux_x86

~$ wget http://www.lephar.com/download/lepro_linux_x86

# Now make the tools executable
~$ chmod +x /path/to/tool

# To use the tools
~$ /path/to/tool
```
But you could also create an alias in the .bash_aliases or .bashrc files. <br>
<br>
Plip: <br>
There are 2 ways to install plip, depending on if you're installing it on your own computer or the bin computers. <br>

On your own laptop/computer:
```bash
~$ pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt --no-deps plip
```

To install plip on a bin computer, you will need to install it in a virtual enviroment. <br>
```bash
~$ python3 -m venv /path/to/newvenv --system-site-packages
# Activate the venv
~$ source /path/to/newvenv/bin/activate
# Install package into the venv
~$ pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt --no-deps plip
```
plip can now be used within the venv. <br>
## gebruikershandleiding voor ontwikkelaar/programmeur
Before running the tools you must already have:
- A .pdb file of the protein
- A .mol2 file of the ligand
- A ligand file without extensions that holds the filenames of all the .mol2 ligand files

Lepro takes a .pdb file and creates a copy called pro.pdb in which things like water molecules and ligands are removed and hydrogen atoms are added.\
It also creates a dock.in file that looks like this:
>Receptor\
>pro.pdb\
>\
>RMSD\
>1.0\
>\
>Binding pocket\
>x<sub>min</sub> x<sub>max</sub>\
>y<sub>min</sub> y<sub>max</sub>\
>z<sub>min</sub> z<sub>max</sub>\
>\
>Number of binding poses\
>20\
>\
>Ligands list\
>ligands_list\
>\
>END

You can change the dock.in. If you want ledock to run faster for example, you can make the Nuber of binding poses lower.
This will cause ledock to run fewer iterations.\
The dock.in is used to run ledock. Ledock uses the file references in the dock.in to effectively get all the data.
ledock uses that data to dock the given ligands and it returns a .dok file with the specified number of binding poses sorted
on score(a lower number is a higher score).\
plip takes a .pdb file to create an image, in this case the .pdb file needs to have the protein and the appropriate ligands
The best way to do this here is to take the appropriate ligands from the .dok file and put them in the pro.pdb.
You can do this because this .dok file is just a .pdb made by ledock.


### voorbeeld commandline
To get pictures out of the .pdb file you usually run:

```bash
~$ lepro XXXXX.pdb\
~$ ledock dock.in\
*add the desired ligands to the pro.pdb*\
~$ plip -f pro.pdb -p --peptides 1 2 3
```

## in/output data
### Input data
To use the tools you need:
- A pdb file of a peptide <br>
    - This contains information about the peptide
- A mol2 file of a ligand
    - Molecular information about the ligand, can be used to render it in pymol for example.

### Output data
- a .dok file
    - This contains a number of position the ligand could be in, it is in an decreasing order. The first ligand has the most optimal position
    
- Pictures of ligand in binding site
    - These pictures show how a ligand is fit into the binding site. There are also bonds formed and showed. PLIP is used for this and gives us a legend to use in said pictures.
