## Biodock visualiser (v. 1.0)

## Description
Understanding interactions between proteins and ligands is of great importance for various branches within molecular biology. Examples of its usage include, but are not limited to, developing new medicines or improving existing ones, aswell as getting a better understanding of various biochemical processes. BioDock Visualiser is a webtool that allows users to dock ligands onto proteins and visualise the result afterwards. The process of 'docking' refers to predicting the most likely configuration of a ligand when it attaches itself to a protein.

## Wat/waarom/wie
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.l images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation(vereisten systeem +handleiding installatie)
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## gebruikershandleiding voor ontwikkelaar/programmeur
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
