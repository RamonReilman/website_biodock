                <h1>How to use</h1>
                <p>
                    To use this website you need to submit a PDB-file of a protein and a MOL2-file of a ligand.
                    You can obtain the protein file by downloading it from the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank</a> 
                    as PDB-file and the ligand MOL2-file can be obtained from the <a href="https://zinc.docking.org/">ZINC database</a>.
                    What each of the files should look like is described in detail in here:
                </p>
                        <ul class="file_info">
                            <li><a href="https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/teaching/260.655/links/pdbformat.pdf">PDB</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.structbio.vanderbilt.edu/archives/amber-archive/2007/att-1568/01-mol2_2pg_113.pdf">MOL2</a><br></li>
                        </ul>
                <p>
                    You can also specify the number of binding poses and the RMSD-cutoff.
                    The number of binding poses is the number of times there is attempted to dock. So if you lower the number the website
                    will run faster but the output will be worse. The number of binding poses is limited to 20, because anything higher
                    will take too long and is in a vast majority of cases unnecessary.<br><br>
                    <b>RMSD</b> or Root Mean Square Division is the measure of average distance between atoms of 
                    molecules and atoms of ligand configurations.
                    It is measured in Ångström (Å). Decreasing this value will give higher accuracy but the docking process 
                    will take longer and higher values will give lower accuracy and a faster docking process.<br>
                    As output you will get a dok file that houses all of the calculated binding poses and three images
                    of the three most optimal calculated binding poses. Those look like this:<br><br>

                    <p>
                        The website takes your input (PDB- and MOL2-file) and runs it through an algorithm to simplify your file (LePro).
                        after that step it runs the new file through an program called LeDock, which contains an AI trained to dock ligands onto proteins. This can take a very long time
                        depending on the number of binding poses specified. This is because this number is the amount of iterations the AI will go through. Each iteration the AI tries to dock the
                        ligand onto the protein, and if the pose works the AI calculates the score, and then it repeats this process.
                        Finally, the outcomes are put in a file in decreasing order based on score and this webtool visualises the top 3 binding-poses using PLIP.

                        The history page is to retrace your steps. Every time you run the webtool the output gets saved to the history page.
                        So if you accidentally delete one of the output files you can download it once again there.

                        The website generates images of the ligand docked in the protein. The molecules and interactions are all different colors. <br>
                        This is why we created a legend, that explains what all of the colors and shapes represent. <br>
                        This legend can be found on the page after you have used the tool.
